Lottery algorithm:
1. The lottery starts by accepting ETH transactions. Anyone having an Ethereum wallet can
send a fixed amount of 0.1 ETH to the contractâ€™s address.
2. The players send ETH directly to the contract address and their Ethereum address is
registered. A user can send more transactions having more chances to win.
3. There is a manager, the account that deploys and controls the contract.
4. At some point, if there are at least 3 playesrs, he can pick a random winner from the
players list. Only the manager is allowed to see the contract balance and to randomly
select the winner.
5. The contract will transfer the entire balance to the winnerâ€™s address and the lottery is
reset and ready for the next round.
