## Solidify Programming

This repository contains useful links, some reminder materials, Solidity porgramming basics examples and my solutions to coding challanges to a course I took called [**Master Ethereum & Solidity Programming From Scratch in 2022**](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ethereum-and-solidity-programming-with-real-world-apps/).

Chainlink and its integration to Ethereum smart contracting was not part of the course material, but just something I tried out of interest.
